                    <p className="px-md-5">Coding is becoming essential in a child’s educational curriculum so that they can be prepared for the developing future. This new literacy is what’s going to be a necessary requirement for jobs in the coming future.
                        Coding is one such language that adds an all-encasing effect on the refinement of a kid's brain. When you teach coding to kids, you essentially shape their brain to be able to tackle several aspects which not only pertain to their education but also to their lives.</p>
                    <p className="px-md-5">Coding already constitutes more than 60% of all jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math. While still in school, those who start young will be ahead of everyone by the time they get into college.</p>
